# SleepTek

## Background and overview

At times we find ourselves browsing through our phones at night just before going to bed for hours and hours. We try with great difficulty to fall asleep for work/school the next day, however we fail multiple times a week. This app will hopefully put you to sleep through its straining effects on your retina.

## Technologies

* Javascript: Most commonly used programming language in web development. Javascript was used in creating the game logic and manipulating the DOM.
* HTML 5: Building block of the web, used to describe the structure of the web application
* CSS: Styling and adding aesthetics for better User Interaction

# Functionality

To create the game logic the under the hood  pixel data was required. Using a variety of functions and click handlers allows for the user to move the ball left and right. The gravity element allows for the ball to fall through the gaps enabling the player to stay alive longer.

# Future of the App
Currently the application is optimized for mouse click event listeners. Making it mobile friendly and adding touch event listeners is the hopefully the future of this app.
