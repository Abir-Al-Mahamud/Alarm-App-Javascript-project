*This clock app will entail a multitude of functionalities (alarm, worldwide times, stopwatch and more) as well as a cool time visuals*

**Background/Overview**
*For years I struggled with deep sleep issues, i would constantly sleep right through my obnoxiously loud alarm that would wake up everyone but me.
So my goal is to create an alarm app that will be unique and force the deepest of sleepers to wakeup from their slumbers *

**Functionality and MVPs**

* In TimeTek users will be able to user alarms that make different sounds based on when the time set by user is reached.
* Users will have access to a stop watch will go on forever until user presses stop.
* Users will be able to play a simple time visual 
* Users will be able to see the time around the world
